version 0.2.4:
  - Export Assoc(..) from Generics.Regular.Functions.Crush (thanks to Martijn
    van Steenbergen).

version 0.2.3:
  - Replaced the flag on the cabal package by an explicit test on the ghc
    version. This makes it easier to build on ghc-6.12.

version 0.2.2:
  - Update to build with ghc-6.12: require template-haskell-2.4.*, adapt
    Generics.Regular.TH accordingly and use CPP to maintain compatibility with
    ghc-6.10

version 0.2.1:
  - Do not export generic equality by default to avoid clashes with Prelude
  - Turn I and K into newtypes

version 0.2:
  - Separated generic functions per modules
  - Added generic unfold
  - Added record selectors
  - Improved generic show, added showsPrec
  - Added generic read
  - Added generic deep seq
  - Added constructor names
